3</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">To</span> hold the vicious up to odium and
contempt should be at all times a particular care of the Press;
but when every powerful engine is exerted to veil the vices of
the privileged ranks, and to make it appear that crime is
peculiar to those who constitute what <i>are called</i> the lower
classes, it becomes a sacred and <i>imperative duty</i>.</p>
<p>We know there are some who, from a pretended regard to
religion, would suppress every fact that exposes the licentious
conduct of its ministers, but, nine times out of ten, this is
mere hypocritical cant to support those who &ldquo;bind heavy
burdens, and grievous to be borne, and lay on men&rsquo;s
shoulders.&rdquo;&nbsp; The mistaken infidel may connect religion
with the conduct of its professors, but the truly religious
person makes no distinction of vice but its comparative enormity,
and the more he venerates the doctrine of Christianity, the
greater abhorrence he feels towards the wretch who violates every
principle of the religion which it is his duty to inculcate.</p>
<p>We see a certain Association evincing a most scandalous
partiality, by <span class="GutSmall">SELECTING</span> the
objects of their prosecution from those most unable to defend
themselves! we participate in the general feeling of censure
against them, and believe <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>that they have done more injury to the
cause they profess to support, than the united efforts of the
persecuted parties could possibly have effected.&nbsp; This will
ever be the case when exertions are influenced only by feelings
of <i>policy</i> instead of <i>principle</i>, for if as much
pains were taken to keep improper characters <i>without</i> the
pale of the church, as there is art exerted to defend them
through thick and thin, when they have <i>entered</i> it, the
<span class="GutSmall">CLOTH</span> would probably never have
been disgraced by the &ldquo;Rev. Father in God,&rdquo; whose
notoriety promises to eclipse that of all former brothers in
divinity.</p>
<p>The name of the Prelate may have appeared in the subscription
columns of a newspaper, the only place where the charity of many
is heard of.&nbsp; Nay, we have little doubt but it might be
found in the list of subscribers to the <i>highly respectable
association</i> the &ldquo;<i>Bridge street gang</i>&rdquo; or
the &ldquo;<i>Society for the suppression of
vice</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; We would not rob <i>him</i> of any action
of <i>merit</i> on this score, or them of any claim to
<i>respectability</i> in the eye of the public; for ourselves we
would say, &ldquo;Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees,
hypocrites, for ye&mdash;also outwardly appear righteous unto
men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and
iniquity.&rdquo;&nbsp; Any comment on the case itself must be
superfluous, we therefore give it to the reader as extracted
verbatim from the Statesman.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><i>July</i> 22, 1822.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> readers have often had to
oblige us by their attention to what we have said of the blessed
THING.&nbsp; We are now going to trouble them upon an
extraordinary occasion indeed, and are going to give an instance
of the baseness and infamy of the London newspapers, such as we
never before had it in our power to give; and such as we are
quite sure will, before we have done with it, implant the
character of everlasting infamy upon that corrupt press, which
has so long been boasting of its independence and its
honour.&nbsp; What a deal we have heard about the press being the
<i>guardian of public morals</i>!&nbsp; What volumes have we read
about its powers of correction of evil!&nbsp; We have, <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>indeed, heard a
part of it condemned, the unstamped part of it; that part of it
has been pointed out the refuse part; as the vile part; as the
part which required laws to restrain it, to cramp it, to load it,
to destroy it if possible.&nbsp; We have heard honourable Members
in the honourable House, make a distinction between the
<i>respectable</i> part of the press and another part, which they
denominated disrespectable.&nbsp; We have heard volumes upon
volumes of commendation, praise and puffery, about this
respectable part of the press.&nbsp; We have always denominated
it infamous; we have always said that that part of it which was
not absolutely in the pay of Corruption was engaged in a sham
warfare, quite as serviceable to Corruption as the efforts of her
own hirelings; and that with perhaps a trifling exception or two,
it was a mass of infamous fraud carried on under the name of
impartiality; sending forth lies, endless in number, and
boundless in magnitude, vomiting forth calumnies on the
defenceless, and <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>suppressing, through the means of bribes, directly or
indirectly received, every fact that could tend to expose the
thing, and give the common people their fair chance in
society.&nbsp; This has been the character of this infamous press
ever since we have known it; but we shall presently have to show
our readers, that it has now surpassed even its own infamy, and
done a deed so black as to make its former infamies turn
pale.</p>
<p>We have first to insert an article from the weekly paper
called <i>The Observer</i>; to which paper the public will be in
great part indebted for the knowledge of the horrible affair
which the article describes.&nbsp; We shall then offer a few
observations, that may serve just for the present on the manner
in which the thing has been and is likely to be illustrated by
the circumstances of the transaction alluded to; and then we
shall lay before our readers an account of the conduct of the
&ldquo;respectable&rdquo; and infamous part of the press, upon
this occasion; naming the several papers; <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>and making them
as notorious; as it is in our power to make them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>From the Observer Sunday
Newspaper</i>, <i>July</i> 21, 1822.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">HORRIBLE
OCCURRENCE</span>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Saturday</span>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is our painful and disgusting task this
day to notice a charge which has been made against a <i>Right
Reverend Bishop</i>, at Marlborough-street police office, at
which human nature revolts.&nbsp; The circumstances are of such
public notoriety at the west end of the town, that it would be in
vain, <i>if any delicacy were due</i> to the party accused, to
attempt to keep them from general observation.&nbsp; The
individual to whom we allude was recently promoted to an Irish
bishopric, and is <i>nearly related to a Peer in
Parliament</i>.&nbsp; He is an elderly man, and we understand was
much respected in that class of society to which he
belonged.&nbsp; On Friday night it appears <i>that he was
detected in a back room of the White Lion public-house</i>, <i>in
St. Alban&rsquo;s place</i>, <i>St. James&rsquo;s</i>, in a
situation with a <i>private </i><a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span><i>in the Foot Guards</i>, to which we
will not more minutely allude, but which led to his instant
apprehension and removal with his companion <i>to the watch
house</i>.&nbsp; There were not fewer than <i>seven witnesses</i>
to the fact; and it would seem that the Reverend Prelate with
difficulty escaped the <i>vengeance of the populace</i>, who, if
not prevented by the peace-officers, would have sacrificed him to
their indignation on the spot.&nbsp; As it was, he was
<i>severely beaten</i>.&nbsp; On being secured in the
watch-house, he offered bail any amount for his liberation; but
this was very properly refused, and he remained locked up in the
cell during the night in a state of mind which may be more easily
imagined than described.&nbsp; Yesterday morning he was conveyed
in a hackney-coach to Marlborough street, and was soon afterwards
followed by the soldier.&nbsp; They were both pursued by the
<i>execrations and revilings of the crowd</i> which had been
collected on so extraordinary an occasion.&nbsp; Mr. Dyer, the
presiding magistrate, determined <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>on a <i>private examination</i>, at
which Mr. Alley, who attended for the Bishop, was present.&nbsp;
The witnesses were called in separately, but their testimony was
in all respects consistent, and the case established was to a
<i>certain extent</i> of the clearest nature.&nbsp; Mr. Alley,
however, submitted that as the capital charge had not been borne
out, his client was <i>entitled to bail</i>; a proposition to
which we understand Mr. Dyer <i>was obliged to accede</i>; and
the wretched offender was permitted, in the course of the day,
<i>to go at large</i>, upon <i>finding sureties</i> to the amount
of <i>one thousand pounds</i>.&nbsp; The soldier, <i>not so
fortunate</i>, was committed <i>to take his trial</i>.&mdash;For
reasons which are obvious, we decline entering more minutely into
the details of this most shocking affair; but we ought in justice
<i>to a worthy prelate</i>, whose name has <i>unfortunately been
mentioned</i> by mistake, in connection with the charge, to
request our readers <i>to reflect</i> before they come to a
<i>positive determination</i> as <i>to the party really
implicated</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>When
our readers have gone through this article, and have heard us
declare our perfect conviction of its truth; when they have heard
us say, that it is agreeable, as far as it goes, with the
enquiries which we have made, when they have further heard, that
the scene of the brutal transaction was in a back room of the
public-house above mentioned; that the parties had drawn the
curtains of the room, but had left a part that the curtains did
not cover but that might be seen through; that a little girl
(vindicatress of her sex!) happening to go into the back court
into which the window looked, wondering to see the curtains
drawn, had the curiosity to look in, where she saw the parties
engaged in that way not to be described, that the little girl
(better guardian of public morals than the respectable part of
the press) ran to the landlord, who came out with other persons
with him, who were all witnesses of the fact, to that certain
extent, at least, of which the <i>Observer</i> speaks; that after
this, the landlord <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>and others laudably went, dashed in the door, took the
parties in the state of Achilles as far as nakedness was
necessary to their intentions; that they then dragged them to the
watch-house, in that very same state: when our readers have heard
all this, they will naturally cry aloud, &ldquo;why is the
<i>name</i> of this Bishop suppressed?&rdquo;&nbsp; It is a
Bishop the article says.&nbsp; It is a &ldquo;venerable
prelate;&rdquo; it is a Right Reverend Father in God; and why
then, is his name suppressed?&nbsp; The <i>Observer</i> informs
us that another &ldquo;worthy prelate&rdquo; has been named; and
unfortunately named; and the <i>Observer</i> requests its readers
to reflect before they come to a positive determination as to who
the party is.&nbsp; What, <i>are all the Bishops</i> then, to
live under this imputation or suspicion?&nbsp; Are all the
Bishops to be suspected for the sake of this wretch, as the
<i>Observer</i> itself justly calls him?&nbsp; This would be
injustice towards the Bishops in general, equal to that which the
most respectable and most infamous part of the press has been
guilty.&nbsp; <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>We shall do our duty.&nbsp; And we here inform our
readers: without anticipating the decisions of courts of justice;
without pretending to know whether the alledged crime can be
proved or not; without pretending to anticipate any thing of this
sort, we inform our readers of that which they all ought to know,
that the person, who was taken from the White Lion public-house
above-mentioned to the watch-house, and who was afterwards taken
from the watch-house to Marlborough-street, and who was held to
bail as above-mentioned; we here inform our readers that that
person who was so taken along with the soldier of the guards was
the <i>Honourable</i> and <i>Right Reverend Father in God</i>,
PERCY JOCELYN, Lord <i>Lord Bishop of Clogher</i>, (lately
translated to that Bishopric from the Bishopric of Ferns,) a
<i>Commissioner of the board of Education</i> (&ldquo;education
of the country!&rdquo;) brother of the late <i>Earl of
Roden</i>.</p>
<p>Having performed this duty, a duty due not less to the Bishops
than to the public, we have further to observe, <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>that a man
was tried in Ireland, no great while ago, on the charge of having
threatened this Bishop to accuse him of such a crime; and, our
readers will hear it with shudderings of horror, this man was
<i>condemned to death</i>, and, of course, upon the oath of this
Bishop!&nbsp; We believe the man was respited and
transported.&nbsp; Upon this we shall make no further
observations for the present.&nbsp; Our readers will need no
observations from us, indeed, to convince them how well things
like this are calculated to excite the envy of surrounding
nations and the admiration of the world.</p>
<p>To return to the article in the <i>Observer</i>, we are
somewhat surprised, if it be true, that Mr. Dyer should have
&ldquo;<i>found himself obliged</i>,&rdquo; and so quickly, too,
and without any remanding, to let the prisoner loose upon bail;
and the public will not fail to observe, and to reflect a little
upon the amount of this bail of a thousand pounds, <i>in such a
case</i>, and relating to such a party.&nbsp; The public will
recollect the bail, the sureties to which Mr. Carlile is
sentenced, and compare that case <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>with this.&nbsp; A thousand pounds,
not, probably, a tenth part of one year&rsquo;s produce of his
Bishopric.&nbsp; The <i>Observer</i> may be in error about
this.&nbsp; The fact has not been officially announced.&nbsp; If
all the other facts stated by the <i>Observer</i> be true, what
is the sum of a thousand pounds!&nbsp; How is that to hold such a
person to stand trial!&nbsp; What <i>sureties</i> are there in a
thousand pounds in such a case!&nbsp; Whether he ever take his
trial or not; the thing will take its trial before the English
people; and on that trial the thing is now put.</p>
<p>The <i>Observer</i> tell us, that the <i>soldier</i> was not
so fortunate.&nbsp; <i>He could not get bail</i>! and was
COMMITTED TO TAKE HIS TRIAL!&nbsp; Well said, THING! it was very
hard that those who bailed the Bishop would not bail the
soldier.&nbsp; The Bishop himself might have been bail for
him.&nbsp; His Bishopric of Clogher was sufficient surety for a
whole battalion.&nbsp; Very hard, indeed, that he was not to be
bailed too!&nbsp; But there will be time enough to talk about
this.&nbsp; The main thing is for us to keep a sharp look out,
and see how the <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>THING; to see how the &ldquo;education of the
country;&rdquo; how the envy of the surrounding nations and
admiration of the world will work this matter!</p>
<p>In the mean while, let us look at the conduct of the
respectable and infamous part of the press of this day, just
looking back in one instance to yesterday.</p>
<p>Our readers will observe, that the articles which we have
quoted were in the Observer of yesterday, consequently the thing
was known to the editors of all the morning papers.&nbsp; If such
a thing had taken place between two labourers, mechanics, or
tradesmen, how it would have been blazoned about through the
morning papers of this day!&nbsp; What a cry would have been set
up by these respectable and infamous guardians of the public
morals!&nbsp; But now, what has been their conduct?&nbsp; The
Morning Post, the British Press, the Morning Herald, and the
Morning Advertizer, have given a part, and a part only, of what
they found in the Observer.</p>
<p>The Morning Herald and the British Press gave nearly the words
of the <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>Observe but inserted the article in as obscure a manner
as possible.&nbsp; The Morning Post curtails the article of the
Observer to about a fifth part, and puts it at the bottom of a
column, in a part of the paper likely to escape
observation.&nbsp; The Morning Advertiser curtails the article
still further; bestows no expression of horror upon the deed, and
merely says, &ldquo;That a person of consideration and a soldier
were taken to the office, charged with a <i>gross
misdemeanor</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We now come to the Morning Chronicle, which fills four columns
of its paper with Mr. Hume&rsquo;s nonsensical resolutions about
the National Debt and the operations of the Sinking Fund; but
which can spare only just seven lines, put in the obscurest part
of all of the paper, to say that &ldquo;two persons&rdquo; (and
not a word about a bishop!) were discovered in a public house,
and so forth.&nbsp; But we will take the very words of the
Chronicle.&nbsp; They will not fill up much space; and they will
enable the public to judge of the real character of this
paper.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A Sunday paper states that on Friday <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>night, <i>two
persons</i> were discovered at public-house in St. James&rsquo;s
market, in a situation which left no doubt respecting the nature
of their crime, that they were taken to watch-house, and brought
to a Police-office on Saturday morning, when it appeared from
papers in the pocket of the one, that he filled a high station,
which we will not name.&nbsp; The magistrate is said to have
admitted them to bail.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Two persons!&rdquo;&nbsp; And the <i>Chronicle</i>
could find out nothing but two persons; though it had read the
<i>Observer</i> as well as we, and though it would not take us
much to prove that the <i>Chronicle</i> must have heard all about
the matter on <i>Saturday night</i>, seeing that an Evening paper
in the neighbourhood <i>had the intelligence actually composed
and going to the press on Saturday afternoon</i>, and had stopped
the press to cancel the matter!&nbsp; From what motive this
cancelling took place, let the indignant public judge.&nbsp; The
<i>Chronicle</i>, had this been an affair between two persons in
common life, would have rung us such a peel upon the subject as
would not soon have <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>been forgotten; and let our readers judge how powerful
must have been the motive that could have induced it, not only to
abridge the article of the <i>Observer</i>, not only to tell less
than it had read in the Sunday paper; not only to cram this
important matter into seven lines and hide it at the bottom of a
column; not only this, but to talk of <i>two persons</i>; not to
name a Bishop or a soldier at all; and to be guilty of the
infamous injustice of imputing by implication the crime
indiscriminately to all classes of Englishmen!</p>
<p>Let us now come to the elect of the respectable part of the
press: <i>John Bull</i>; the <i>New Times</i>; and the OLD
TIMES.&nbsp; We have already told our readers, that these were
all of the same stamp; and now we shall see.&nbsp; <i>John
Bull</i> is quite silent.&nbsp; <i>John</i> came out very late on
Sunday morning.&nbsp; There was a rumour on float on Saturday,
and we have already related, that an evening paper had actually
got the matter set up; that is to say the types composed for
printing an account of the transaction! and that it was induced
<a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>to stop
the press, take out the article, scatter the types and put in
another article in its stead, probably an article from the Vice
Society or from some Bible Society.&nbsp; What happened to John
Bull we do not know precisely; but something seems to have seized
John all at once early on Sunday morning, or in the middle of the
night before.&nbsp; For, we sent to get John&rsquo;s paper, on
Sunday morning about ten o&rsquo;clock; and the vender of the
paper informed us, that it would not come out till very late,
because an <i>accident had happened to the machinery</i> in the
office.&nbsp; This was the story told to those who went to buy
the paper!&nbsp; Yes, our readers will see that John&rsquo;s
machinery had been operated upon by something perfectly
accidental, and yet of a very potent nature.</p>
<p>Now. we come to that brace of brothers, the <i>New</i> and
<i>Old Times</i>.&nbsp; Perfectly silent both!&nbsp; Not a single
word upon the subject,&mdash;not a single allusion to it, though
the Old one has actually put forth this day two papers, which it
<i>sells for one</i>, in pursuance of those desperate efforts
which it is making <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>to sustain itself.&nbsp; It has two papers, measuring
nearly two feet square, containing 16 square feet of print, one
and a half square foot of which consists of an advertisement of
the Irish Subscription.&nbsp; In the whole of this 16 feet of
square print, room was not to be found for the insertion of one
single word about the Bishop and the Soldier! not a single
allusion.&nbsp; Nothing that could let its readers suppose that
such a thing had taken place.&nbsp; The <i>cause</i> of this need
not be stated to our readers: they will all see the cause at
once; and they will all despise the man that they shall in future
see with one of these papers in his hand.</p>
<p>We could here, if we had time, refer to the statement of Dr.
O&rsquo;Meara, or rather to what the Times has said about the
bribe of &pound;3000, the evidence of which Buonaparte found
amongst the papers of the run-away Bourbon.&nbsp; We must leave
that to be noticed another time; and in the mean time request our
readers to pay attention to the facts which we have now stated,
<a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>never
forgetting the sentences on <span class="smcap">Joseph
Swan</span>, Mr. <span class="smcap">Carlile</span>, his wife and
sister.&nbsp; We have said before and we repeat it, that the
<span class="GutSmall">THING</span> is now fairly on its
trail.&nbsp; In former cases, there may have been doubts and
difficulties in the way; there may have been that which blinded
and deluded honest and well-meaning people; but here the matter
lies in a nut-shell.&nbsp; Here the question is too plain to
admit of being obscured and too monstrous to admit of
palliation.&nbsp; The time cannot be distant when the decision
shall take place; and in the mean time we beseech our readers to
keep watch; to look at the conduct of all these papers, to
contrast that conduct with that which they shewed in the case of
the Vere-street gang, to compare their present conduct; their
present silence with the unsparing, but just and laudable
abhorrence which they then expressed: our readers are requested
to make this comparison, at the same time that they make a
comparison between the rank and riches of the party now
offending, and the obscurity and <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>comparative poverty of the parties
then offending.&nbsp; They are requested to do this, and we are
sure they will exclaim with us, that this &ldquo;respectable part
of the press&rdquo; is surely the most infamous thing that ever
existed in any country in the world.</p>
<p>We must quit the subject for the present; but not without
assuring our readers that, strong as corruption is, great as are
her powers of smothering and stifling, she will not have it in
her power to stifle the truth in this case.&nbsp; We care not how
the <span class="GutSmall">THING</span> acts.&nbsp; Let the <span
class="GutSmall">THING</span> do what it pleases; and let the
public watch it; look sharp after the movements of the <span
class="GutSmall">THING</span>, and see what it will do.&nbsp;
Thus we close our remarks for the present, leaving the public, as
we trust it will, to congratulate itself on the existence of one
newspaper that cannot be <i>hushed</i> into silence.</p>
<p>We cannot dismiss this article without observing that it is
with great and unfeigned <i>sorrow</i> that we have to record
this degradation of rank and dignity; but the way to uphold rank
<a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>and
dignity is not to be guilty of such base partiality as that which
we have noticed; and the best way is to single out, as we have
done, the guilty, and leave it to be supposed that it forms an
exception to the mass.</p>

law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
